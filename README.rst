Limitations
-----------

As this is an early development version:

* Only JPEG and PNG are supported as input file. This will be improved in the future to allow opening any image format supported by `Pillow <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

* PNG Optimization is very, very, **VERY** slow due to too unbalanced ZoppfliPNG optimization options set by YOGA, this will be improved in the future.

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please consider `filing a bug <https://github.com/flozz/yoga-image-optimizer/issues>`_ before starting to work on a new feature. This will allow us to discuss the best way to do it. This is of course not necessary if you just want to fix some typo or small errors in the code.

Please note that your code must pass tests and follow the coding style defined by the `pep8 <https://pep8.org/>`_. `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ and `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ are used on this project to enforce coding style.

Running The Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::

    pip3 install nox

Then you can check for lint error::

    nox --session lint

or run the tests::

    nox --session test

You can also fix automatically coding style errors with::

    nox -s black_fix

To run the tests only for a specific Python version, you can use following commands (the corresponding Python interpreter must be installed on your machine)::

    nox --session test-3.7
    nox --session test-3.8
    nox --session test-3.9
