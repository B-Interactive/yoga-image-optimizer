.SH DESCRIPTION

YOGA Image Optimizer is a graphical user interface for YOGA Image that converts
and optimizes the size of JPEGs, PNGs and WebP image files.

.TP
.B JPEG
JPEGs are optimized using the \fIGuetzli\fR library. During the optimization,
all file metadata will be removed.

.TP
.B PNG
PNGs are optimized using the \fIZopfliPNG\fR library. During the optimization,
the color space can be converted from RGBA to RGB or indexed color to reduce
the size of the output file. All metadata will be removed from output file.

.TP
.B WebP
Both lossy and lossless WebPs are processed using the \fIlibwebp\fR library, so
there will be probably no gain to process already encoded WebPs. All metadata
will be removed from the output file.
